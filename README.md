## Summary
The data suggests that for reviews of wrist watches, Vine members did not show any bias for positive reviews. If anything, the opposite result was seen where the percentage of positive reviews was significantly less for Vine members. To further see if this is true, we could filter for verified purchases as well or expand our data to find the percent for 3 or more stars, not just 5 stars.
